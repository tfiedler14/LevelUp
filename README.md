# LevelUp
Level up is designed to give users a fun and rewarding was to push themselves towards "leveling up" real world skills. The application allows users to create a profile and then create skills associated with preset attributes they would like to improve in their everyday life. These attributes include: academics, community, crafts, fitness, hobby, mental. For example, if a user would like to improve their fitness, they may create skills like weightlifting and cardio. After the user creates their skills, they create a custom quest to help them improve that skill. Once these quests are complete, the user will gain experience in the related skills. As the user continues to gain experience, their character sheet will level up and allow them to visually see their progress. Quests and skills are completely customizable so the user can set their own goals and improve at their own pace.
The final code can be viewed on the master branch of this repository.
